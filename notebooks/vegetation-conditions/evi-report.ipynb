    "## Literature Review: Remote Sensing for Agricultural Yield Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between crop yields and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), a proxy for vegetation health derived from satellite imagery, is central to agricultural forecasting (Johnson, 2016). EVI is a spectral index that utilizes the blue, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands of satellite data to monitor vegetation health and productivity. Relative to other vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EVI provided superior performance by offering increased sensitivity in high biomass areas and mitigating atmospheric effects (Huete et al., 2002). Johnson (2016) provides a comprehensive overview of the use of EVI in agricultural yield prediction, highlighting its advantages over other indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The study concluded that EVI was among the best overall performer in predicting crop yields, showing the highest correlation in five out of nine crops studied, excluding rice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous studies have successfully utilized EVI to predict yields of various crops, including maize, soybeans, and rice. For instance, Bolton and Friedl (2013) created a linear model using EVI to forecast soybean and maize yields in the Central United States. Their findings demonstrate that EVI exhibits a stronger correlation with maize yield and yield anomalies than other vegetation indices, and incorporating phenological data significantly enhances the model’s performance. A study in Thailand by Wijesingha et al. (2015) investigated the use of MODIS EVI for rice crop monitoring and yield assessment. Their research revealed that maximum EVI achieved a high correlation of 0.95 with rice yield, indicating its effectiveness in yield prediction. Furthermore, Son et al. (2013) used MODIS EVI data for rice yield prediction in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, reporting high correlation coefficients (R2 of 0.70 for spring-winter and 0.74 for autumn-summer in 2013, and 0.62-0.71 and 0.4-0.56 in 2014, respectively). Lastly, a study in one of the major rice-producing areas in China, Yangtze River Delta region, by Shi & Huang (2015) further confirmed that the MODIS-based area shows higher consistency with agricultural census data during the period of 2000-2010, with less than 15% error.\n",

    "### Satellite and Ground-Based Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to ground-based methods, such as field interviews and crop cuttings, Remote sensing approach has several advantages on estimating crop yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Timeliness and Rapid Assessment: Remote sensing offers real-time or near real-time assessment of crop conditions and potential yields, which is crucial for situations like natural disasters or conflicts (Deininger et al. 2023; Doraiswamy et al. 2003).\n",
    "- Extensive Spatial Coverage and Granularity: Satellite imagery can consistently cover large geographic areas, providing granular, field, and village-level data that can be aggregated to higher administrative levels, such as districts or provinces (Azzari, Jain, and Lobell 2017; Becker-Reshef et al. 2010).\n",
    "- Cost-Effectiveness: Remote sensing is generally more cost-effective for collecting agricultural data over large areas compared to ground-based methods (Johnson 2016; Rahman et al. 2009).\n",
    "- Accessibility in Difficult or Dangerous Areas: Remote sensing provides a reliable option for data collection in zones that are difficult, dangerous, or inaccessible for in-situ surveys, such as conflict areas (Jaafar et al. 2015).\n",
    "- Independent and Consistent Data Source: Remote sensing offers an independent data source that can validate or complement ground-based data, which may be subject to biases or inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, remote sensing also has several limitations:\n",
    "- Spatial Resolution Limitations: While modern sensors offer higher resolutions, coarse resolution data may not accurately reflect ground situations for small agricultural clusters, small parcels, or low-intensity agriculture (Kibret, Marohn, and Cadisch 2020).\n",
    "- Significant Computational Demands: Analyzing high-resolution imagery requires massive amounts of computational power and storage, which can be expensive and time-consuming (Petersen 2018).\n",
    "- Interpretability and Bias Concerns: Satellite-derived metrics may not fully capture all determinants of crop production and may not quantitatively interpret crop growth status (Wu et al. 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "While remote sensing offers timely, broad-scale, and cost-effective monitoring, particularly in data-scarce or inaccessible regions, it faces challenges with resolution limitations, computational demands, and potential biases in interpreting crop conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EVI and Other Vegetation Indices\n",
    "Within the remote sensing approach itself, multiple vegetation indices have been utilized to enhance the accuracy of yield predictions. Compared to other vegetation indices, EVI offers several advantages over other vegetation indices:\n",
    "- Reduced saturation: EVI does not saturate as quickly as NDVI at higher crop\n",
    "leaf area or in areas with large amounts of biomass, providing improved sensitivity in dense vegetation conditions (Huete et al. 2002). This is crucial as high saturation in indicators like NDVI can lead to unreliable yield estimates (Son et al. 2013).\n",
    "- Atmospheric and Soil Correction: EVI incorporates a soil adjustment factor and corrections for the red band due to aerosol scattering, making it more resistant to atmospheric influences and soil background noise compared to NDVI (Jurečka et al. 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, EVI also has some limitations compared to other vegetation indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal Resolution and Latency: While EVI is disseminated at 250m resolution, it may only be available at 16-day time steps, compared to NDVI’s 8-day availability, which could introduce latency issues for real-time monitoring (Johnson 2016)\n",
    "- Mixed Pixel Problems: Coarse spatial resolution of MODIS EVI (250m or 500m) can limit performance in regions with small, fragmented parcels (Kibret, Marohn, and Cadisch 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Climate influenced on EVI\n",
    "\n",
    "EVI values are influenced by several environmental factors. EVI is sensitive to rainfall patterns, as the variations of phenological stages of crops, such as the timing of planting and harvesting, are closely linked to rainfall (Kibret, Marohn, and Cadisch 2020). Additionally, while EVI is designed to be resistant to atmospheric aerosols, cloud contamination, particularly during wet seasons, can affect vegetation greenness signals and lower the accuracy of yield predictions (Son et al. 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling Approaches of EVI\n",
    "\n",
    "Several modeling approaches have been successfully employed with EVI data for crop yield prediction. Statistical models, particularly linear and quadratic regression, are widely used due to their fewer data requirements and assumptions compared to biophysical models (Ji et al. 2022). Linear regression models are frequently applied, with EVI generally performing well and showing more linear relationships with yields than NDVI for certain crops (Tiruneh et al. 2023). Machine learning approaches have also proven effective, with Kibret, Marohn, and Cadisch (2020) applied Random Forest algorithm to MODIS EVI time series for agricultural land use classification and cropping system identification. Pham et al. (2022) demonstrated that integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with machine learning methods (PCA-ML) on VCI data effectively addresses spatial variability and redundant data issues, enhancing prediction accuracy by up to 45% in rice yield forecasting for Vietnam.\n",

The blue dots represent the raw EVI values, the black line represents the processed EVI values, and the dotted lines represent season parameters extracted for that pixel: start of season, peak of season, and end of season."

    "The regression results demonstrate a strong and robust relationship between lagged EVI and agricultural GDP across all model specifications. Lagged EVI (one quarter ago) consistently emerges as the most important predictor of agricultural GDP, showing high statistical significance (p < 0.01) and stable coefficients across all models that include it (Models 2-4). In the full specification model (model 4), the lagged EVI coefficient can be interpreted as: comparing two observations that differ by 1% in lagged EVI, the model predicts on average a difference of 1.15% in agricultural GDP, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that an alternative specification including rainfall was tested but suffered from severe multicollinearity with EVI measures. The high correlation is expected given that rainfall is a primary driver of vegetation greenness, leading to inflated standard errors and unstable coefficient estimates."

    "When we zoom in on the year of 2024 and 2025 and compare the annual median EVI during the early crop growing season (July to October), it appears that the EVI values for 2025 are higher than 2024. This may suggest a potential improvement in vegetation health and crop conditions in 2025 compared to the previous year. However, this observation should be interpreted with caution, as the EVI for 2025 only includes data up to early October, and the full growing season data is not yet available. Further monitoring and analysis will be necessary to confirm whether this trend continues through the end of the year."

The uniform application of a single binary crop season indicator across all regions may lead to misspecification, absorbing temporal variation in some regions while failing to capture it accurately in others.\n",

The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, with predicted agricultural GDP values closely aligning with observed figures for 2023 and 2024. However, the model prediction on Q1 2025 diverges from expectations, potentially due to unforeseen factors affecting agricultural productivity that are not captured by EVI alone."

    "The analysis demonstrates a robust relationship between lagged EVI and agricultural GDP at both national and regional levels. Lagged EVI consistently emerges as a significant predictor of agricultural GDP. However, it is important to note that while EVI effectively reflects vegetation health and crop conditions, and its predictive power on crop yield is evident, it does not capture the full complexity of agricultural GDP. Furthermore, the  the predictive relationship observed in historical data may not hold under changing conditions, such as ongoing political and economic transitions, natural disasters, climate variability and extreme weather events."
