# Data Lab Strategic Brief: Myanmar Economic Monitor

A **Strategic Brief** is a high-level set of recommendations prepared by the [Data Lab](https://wbdatalab.org) that address a given challenge. Recommendations may include internal and external data resources, specific colleagues and/or teams with relevant expertise, data management best practices, suggestions for exploration, and/or a list of relevant resources and
similar projects.

Should you have any questions about the Brief, please contact: datalab@worldbank.org

## Project Overview

The Myanmar Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment team is responsible for undertaking macroeconomic surveillance of Myanmar and conducting analytical studies to guide economic policy and development, including the bi-annual Myanmar Economic Monitor (P179106). However, published data can be delayed or unreliable, making traditional macroeconomic monitoring a challenge.  

The Task Team seeks advisory on alternative data sources, especially remote sensing and satellite imagery, to better understand the current state of the Myanmar economy.  Specifically, the team seeks to use these data to track economic activities in key sectors of the economy and assess how current developments -- COVID, military coup, sanctions, power outages, and internal displacement due to conflict – are impacting economic outcomes.

The **Data Lab** advisory is presented in three sections:

- **Data Collection and Acquisition**: Identified data resources that could support the earthquake socio-economic impact analysis.

- **Data Management**: Recommendations for managing derived project datasets.

- **Data Analytics and Insight Dissemination**: A menu of proposals for analytical work that could be coordinated through the Lab.

## Data Collection and Acquisition

*This section includes a range of data collection and acquisition recommendations, such as open data resources, leveraging private data partnerships, current World Bank subscriptions and licenses, survey solutions, and remote sensing.*

## Data Management

*This section includes data privacy policy, data storage and access policy and infrastructure, compute infrastructure, data license compliance, data security classifications, data sovereignty policy, etc.*

- **Collecting Data**. If data acquisition involves contracting a vendor for data collection, consider utilizing a ToR Template prepared with checklists of what you can include to ensure data quality, proper data handling and transfer of data throughout the data collection process. Contact [Cathrine Machingauta](mailto:cmachingauta@worldbank.org) (DECDG) for assistance. 

- **Sourcing Data from External Sources**. When obtaining data from external sources (e.g., vendors, contractors, Government) the team should ensure that any licensing or terms of use are documented and stored along with the data. Metadata documentation should also be prepared for any data received to describe the structure and content of the data. This greatly assists in data transparency and reuse. Please contact [Cathrine Machingauta](mailto:cmachingauta@worldbank.org) (DECDG) if you have questions about data and licensing. 

- **Personal Data Privacy**. If your project involves processing personal data i.e., collection, storage, use, transmission, disclosure or deletion any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual, contact your business unit's Privacy Focal point for further guidance and compliance with the Bank's Privacy policy. You can find your Privacy Focal point on this [Data Privacy SharePoint site.](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fworldbankgroup.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms%2Fsites%2Fwbsites%2FWBDP%2FSitepages%2FDetail.aspx%2FDocuments%2Fmode%3Dview%3F_Id%3D134%26SiteURL%3D%2Fsites%2Fwbsites%2FWBDP%26McasTsid%3D15600&McasCSRF=a23286b96554bdf2bb45f530a7ef684e2eec1746893939d64046ccd9f3c587c2) 

- **Storage and Discoverability**. To effectively manage source data and project outputs, the Task Team should consider depositing data in the [Development Data Hub](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdatacatalog.worldbank.org.mcas.ms%2Fhome%3FMcasTsid%3D15600&McasCSRF=a23286b96554bdf2bb45f530a7ef684e2eec1746893939d64046ccd9f3c587c2) (DDH) in accordance with the Bank Procedure for Development Data Acquisition, Archiving and Dissemination and Guidance on Development Dataset Acquisition and Archiving. The [Data Catalog](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdatacatalog.worldbank.org.mcas.ms%2Fhome%3FMcasTsid%3D15600&McasCSRF=a23286b96554bdf2bb45f530a7ef684e2eec1746893939d64046ccd9f3c587c2) provides long-term storage for data, with support for versioning and updates as required. The Catalog makes data easily discoverable, downloadable and accessible via API. This would ensure data is organized during, and remains available beyond, the project for follow-up study or reuse by other Bank staff (as appropriate), in effect creating another useful deliverable from the project. Contact the Development Data Hub Lab Lead [Rochelle O’Hagan](mailto:%20rohagan@worldbank.org) (DECDG) for assistance.

## Data Analytics and Insight Dissemination

*With acquired data and sufficient data management procedures and infrastructure in place, how do we responsibly generate and share insights from these data? This section includes economics and statistical analysis, data science (AI/ML), app development, geospatial analytics, code collaboration best practices, reproducible code best practices, data product licensing, etc.*

After a brief check-in with the Myanmar Economic Monitor team, the following ideas for analytical contributions were discussed.

| General Approach    | With the popularization of smartphone usage and connectivity across the world, the last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility datasets, such call detail records, geo-tagged posts from social media platforms and generated from GPS devices. These datasets have propelled a [rich scientific production](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=mobility%20data&sort=relevance) on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from epidemiology to disaster resilience, urban planning and transportation engineering.<br>Through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/),staff now have access to high-frequency location-based mobility data, constituted of high temporal and spatial resolution timestamped geographical points generated by GPS-enabled devices.<br> By overlaying population and socioeconomic data with mobility data, the project team will be able to produce an analysis based on the estimation of home locations and population displacement to be delivered on a weekly basis. The results could shed light on the earthquake's effects on different areas and/or populations aggregated by seismic intensity, wealth group or additional features that become available.<br> In addition, a point of  interest rate visit analysis may show to what degree the decrease in movement and activity in business and commercial centers may correlate to the economic outlook, comparing to historical data.The project team may leverage both Meta and mobile device generated data, as well as official UN statsitics and other data sources as they become available to support cross-validation. <br>All analytics will be supported by at least two data sources, where possible – for example, combining Meta movement statistics with mobile-device location data and comparing with official UNHCR data.<br>See also: [Mobility for resilience: displacement analysis &mdash; mobilkit documentation](https://mobilkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/M4R_02_DisplacementAnalysis.html) and [Observed Cross-Border Mobility Traces in Lebanon and Syria](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/mobility/README.html) |

| Limitations         | The methodology relies on private intent data in the form of mobile location data. In other words, the input data was not produced or collected to analyze the population of interest or address the research question as its primary goal but repurposed for the public good. The< benefits and caveats when using private intent data have been extensively discussed in the [World Development Report 2021](https://wdr2021.worldbank.org/).<br> On the one hand, the mobility data panel is spatially and temporally granular and readily available, on the other hand it is created as a convenience sampling which constitutes an important source of bias.

### II. Understanding Economic Impacts

The Lab proposes focusing on the following key business activity and business
supporting infrastructure indicators:

#### II.A. Observed Electricity Usage at Night

Changes in nigttimelight activity can indicate changes in availability of electricity, mass movements of people, relative economic activity intensity, and changes in gas flaring activity. Some of our sample work using this methodology can be seen [as part of the Syria Economic Monitor.](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/ntl-analysis/README.html)

| Limitations         | Nighttime lights are a common data source for measuring local economic activity. However, it is a proxy that is strongly—although imperfectly—correlated with measures of interest, such as population, local GDP, and wealth. Consequently, care must be taken in interpreting reasons for changes in lights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### II.C. Shipping Trends

To monitor seaborn trade activity in ports, the Lab proposes use of the Automatic Identification System (hereafter, AIS). AIS was originally developed by the International Maritime Organization in 2004 to prevent collisions between large vessels. This system requires all commercial ships (gross tonnage greater than 300) and passenger ships to broadcast their position via ground stations and satellites. A nascent literature has been dedicated to convert raw AIS messages into economic values of trade, utilizing dynamic information on ship movements, static characteristics of each ship, and reported draft (depth of submergence), to estimate the amount of goods offloaded or loaded at a certain port. More details about this methodology may be found here: [Seaborn Trade Activity Estimation](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/ais-analysis/README.html)

#### II.D. Agricultural Productivity

Satellite-derived climate datasets that can be monitored with different temporal resolutions (monthly, daily, and forecast). The variables covered include precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and drought indices. Monitoring these variables in a real-time fashion enables the early detection of water stress in vegetation areas, and helps various actors prepare for climate impacts.

Growing season can be easily observed through phenology metrics measurements using remote sensing (earth observation – EO) data. State of planting and harvesting estimates are determined by importing Vegetation Indices (VI) data into TIMESAT – an open-source program to analyze time-series satellite sensor data. TIMESAT conducts pixel-by-pixel classification of satellite images to determine whether planting has started or not.

Phenological events are sensitive to climate variation. Therefore, phenology data provide important baseline information to assess ecological trends and identify climate change impacts. Comparing current VI values with the long-term averages, and with minimum and maximum values, helps to better understand the performance of the vegetative season and its expected productivity.

| Limitations         | All the data and analysis is merely based upon the most current publicly available remote sensing data. As the climate phenomena is a dynamic situation, the current realities may differ from what is depicted in this document. Ground check is necessary to ensure if satellite and field situation data are corresponding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### III. Understanding Social Impacts

To get a sense of “need intensity,” the team can explore use of the Google Health
Trends API (available through the Development Data Partnership) to determine
temporally and by region changes in queries related to key terms provided by
the Task Team (e.g., “water,” “money transfer,” “pediatrician,” “hospital,”
“Covid”). The method can be adjusted to incorporate other datasets, such as
news (GDELT) or social media data.

| General Approach    | 1.     Identify search terms that can be queried on Google Trends API <br>2.     Map the changes in search terms as they correspond to ACLED-reported conflict data and Covid spikes. <br>3.     Verify if this change can be attributed to a change in connectivity network coverage <br>4.     Identify areas where there is an unnatural spike in number of times a search term appears and compare to ACLED , Covid-incidence data, and news data <br>5.     Compare results with HH survey data to identify corrolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Limitations         | Google Trends relies on people with an active internet connection to search, which excludes people without internet access or who do not use Google search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### IV. Dissemination and Capacity Building

Since analytical results from this work could support additional teams and
counterparts, the team create a centralized repository of all datasets used in analytical
work an ensure all data are suitably documented and made accessible (where
licensing permits), and that all methodologies are similarly made available
through [GitHub](https://github.com/worldbank), so that others can reproduce the results. The [Support for the Syria Economic Monitor](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor) is an example.

Additionally, the Lab can produce a web-based map for layering indicators for ready
comparative analysis, as well as an Excel workbook for ease of indicator dissemination
across the widest possible audience.

### Development Data Partnership’s Community and Documentation

The [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org) fosters a community of data
practitioners and maintains a robust data documentation and code collaboration
platform based on GitHub, which is recognized as a good practice in the World
Bank and in partner international organizations. See more at [https://docs.datapartnership.org](https://docs.datapartnership.org).
